##  Predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the power plan
## Introduction
Electricity is one of the most important resources due to its cost and accessibility. There are many electrical power plants in the world. The main focus of these power plants is on supplying the human communities with the required amount of electricity. In this study, I work with a large amount of power plant data. This data set consists of temperature, ambient pressure, relative humidity, exhaust gas vacuum and hourly electrical net energy. The main goal is to predict the net hourly electrical energy from the power plant. 
## Service Description:
1. In the winter season the temperature can drop to zero and in the summer season it can rise to high. Therefore, if we are able to predict net electrical hourly energy at a certain temperature, we can easily estimate how much oil, hydro and other amounts we need to generate electricity. 
2. Similarly, if we can predict the net hourly electrical energy, we know about the approximate range of ambient pressure, relative humidity, exhaust vacuum in that predicted net hourly electrical energy. Hence we can figure out how much ambient pressure, relative humidity and exhaust vacuum we need to produce a fixed amount of electrical energy.
# Business Idea:
Most of the South Asian power plant runs without proper plan. They make a high amount of budget each year for producing electricity. In India, 30% of the energy input wasted by industry amounts to 160 billion kWh annually, according to the report. Similarly, other countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan wasted the same percentage of energy input. Million dollars are wasting due to adequate research data. They can reduce energy input waste, as well as save tons of money with the proper upstream of research data. Hence, the key business goal is to give the predictive outcome to those countries that are facing the huge amount of energy production wastage and losing their millions of dollars.
